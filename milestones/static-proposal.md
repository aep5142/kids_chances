## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

It changed completely. At first I was going to show the current status and
comparisons of educational levels across different countries, but data was mostly
numerical and there wasn't too much to show.
Now, Im showing an overview of evolution of Tertiary education (after high School)
in Chile during the last 20 years.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

No, I'm relying in clean datasets. Details:

### Dataset 1: Enrolled students and careers in Chile for 2007-2025 (too big to upload)
