# High Education Financing in Chile

Agustín Eyzaguirre

## Description

The following project aims to narrate how the implementation of the Crédito con 
Aval del Estado **(CAE)** — a state-backed student loan policy introduced in 
Chile in 2005 — reshaped access to higher education and transformed the country’s
higher education landscape. Building on the accelerated growth of higher education
during the 1990s and early 2000s, the CAE expanded enrollment opportunities for
students from lower- and middle-income families, fueling an unprecedented rise 
in both the number of programs and institutions. However, this rapid expansion 
came with significant consequences: the financial burden of debt fell heavily on
 households, while questions about educational quality and profit within private
institutions intensified. These tensions eventually crystallized into massive 
student protests during the early 2010s, which demanded reforms to the financing
system and laid the groundwork for the later implementation of Chile’s 
tuition-free higher education policy.

This project delivers an infographic in pdf format showing a series of indicators
on how CAE implementation the High Education landscape. A screenshot is the following:
